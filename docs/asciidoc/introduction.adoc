== Introduction to the Project

The Generic Adaptor, created by JRC in 2023, is designed to facilitate the development of adaptors during the CISE Node
v2 project's pre-operational and operational phases. It standardizes common elements in adaptor development,
streamlining the process and minimizing the need to "reinvent the wheel."

== Project Scope and Objectives

The primary objective of the Generic Adaptor is to provide a framework that handles standard communication elements with
the CISE Node while allowing stakeholders to implement custom logic through plugins. It aims to reduce development time
for stakeholders by providing a common foundation for adaptor creation.
