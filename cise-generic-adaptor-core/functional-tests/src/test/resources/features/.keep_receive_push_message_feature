#//TODO,@Synchro: check if anything usefull here
#//concurrent case: This scenario checks the ability of the Adaptor to handle multiple messages concurrently, which is crucial for performance and scalability in a real-world environment.
  Scenario: Adaptor successfully processes multiple messages
    Given the adaptor is running and ready to receive messages
    When multiple messages are sent to the adaptor
    Then all messages are accepted by the adaptor
    And all messages are validated successfully
    And the sender receives a synchronous acknowledgement of successful validation for each message
    And all messages are transformed into Legacy System data
    And all messages are passed to the Legacy System successfully


#//LS unreachable due to internal issue, This scenario tests the Adaptor's ability to handle cases where messages cannot be transformed into Legacy System data. This is an important aspect of the system to ensure proper error handling and resilience.
#   hack with 2 actors and checking with mock what reached end will not work because there was an error on a way - where should we catch and report those? and how to recover from them?
  Scenario: Adaptor fails to transform message into Legacy System data
    Given the adaptor is running and ready to receive messages
    When a message is sent to the adaptor
    Then the adaptor accepts the message
    And the message is validated successfully
    And the sender receives a synchronous acknowledgement of successful validation
    And the message fails to be transformed into Legacy System data
    And the Legacy System does not receive the message
    # And what? (the adaptor sends an error ack to the sender?)


#//Then the message delivery retries are exhausted without successful message delivery to the Legacy System.
  Scenario: Message delivery retries are exhausted
    Given the adaptor is running and ready to receive messages
    When a message is sent to the adaptor
    And the message delivery retries are exhausted without successful delivery to the Legacy System
    Then the message is not passed to the Legacy System
    And the sender receives an error ack


#//Then the Generic Adaptor is unresponsive or offline (not reachable).
# is there some responsibility for infrastructure, API, to report that adapter is offline?
  Scenario: Generic Adaptor (apart from API/Gateway) is unresponsive or offline
    Given the Generic Adaptor (apart from API/Gateway) is unresponsive or offline
    When a message is sent to the adaptor
    Then the message is not received by the Generic Adaptor
    And the sender receives a connection error ack


#//Then the Legacy System is unresponsive or offline (not reachable). Important for proper error handling and system resilience.
  Scenario: Legacy System is unresponsive or offline
    Given the Legacy System is unresponsive or offline
    When a message is sent to the adaptor
    Then the message is received by the Generic Adaptor
    And the message fails to be passed to the Legacy System
    And the adaptor sends an error ack to the sender
OR
  Scenario: Adaptor fails to send a message to Legacy System due to access failure
    Given Adaptor receives a valid message
    And Adaptor responds to the sender with a success acknowledgement
    When Adaptor tries to pass the transformed message to Legacy System
    But there is an access failure between Adaptor and Legacy System
    Then Legacy System does not receive or process the message


#//Then the Generic Adaptor cannot perform the necessary data translation and mapping.
#//Then the message is corrupted or incomplete
#is Adaptor aware about data model version that is being used, did we ever validated message checking correctness of ns4? "<ns4:PullRequest xmlns:ns4="http://www.cise.eu/servicemodel/v1/message/">"
#sub-cases:
#data mapping and translation performed by the Generic Adaptor is invalid or incorrect.
#XML file is not well-formed or valid.
#XML is well-formed but CISE data is malformed or missing.
  Scenario: Generic Adaptor cannot perform necessary data translation and mapping
    Given the adaptor is running and ready to receive messages
    When a message is sent to the adaptor
    And the Generic Adaptor cannot perform necessary data translation and mapping
    Then the message is not passed to the Legacy System
    And the adaptor sends an error ack to the sender


#//same/similar for LS? are we giving this responsibility totally to client? should there be defined any flows in this area?
  Scenario: Adaptor fails to authenticate request
    Given the adaptor is running and ready to receive messages
    When an unauthorized request is sent to the adaptor
    Then the adaptor rejects the request with an unauthorized/forbidden error ack
    And the sender receives the error ack


#//additional cases maybe to write scenarios from
#the message delivery status is not confirmed to the Cise Node.
#the message type is unknown or unsupported - LS didnt care about this type of message (for example Subscribe, yet it came and is passed through to customers Custom code)


#//filter for simulator test metrics collected (is there anything functional from this lists Ive missed?)
