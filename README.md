> The common information sharing environment (CISE) is an EU initiative providing a decentralised framework for point-to-point information exchange across sectors and borders. It is involving more than 300 EU and national authorities with responsibilities in maritime surveillance.
>
> CISE aims to make European and national maritime surveillance systems interoperable, enabling all concerned authorities to exchange information in an automatic and secure way.
